TankBattle v0.5

A simple one-player tank game with random landscape generator. 

How to play:
*Play with keyboard.
*Each time game starts, the wall layout will be generated randomly. Unique fun every time.
*Press "CTRL" to fire missile, press "SPACE" to deploy cluster missiles in emergency. 
*When you won, press "R" to regenerate enemies.
*When you lose, press "F2" to resurrect.
*When tank was hit, its blood count reduced, show on blood indicator and blood number. Eat "green beans" to recover. 
*Game can be played indefinitely, close window to terminate. 

Issue Note: 10/20/2013
1. Tanks may be deployed on a wall when game starts, Collision Check and Position Recovery does not work in this condition. 
2. Random wall generation may create enclosed or narrowed space, which will limit tank maneuvering and shooting capability. Restart game will solve it.
